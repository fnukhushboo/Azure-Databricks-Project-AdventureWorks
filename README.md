This is a self-initiated learning project focused on building an end-to-end data pipeline. The project involves reading data from GitHub, ingesting it into Azure Data Factory (ADF), performing data transformations and processing in Azure Databricks, and finally publishing interactive reports. The objective is to gain hands-on experience with cloud-based data integration, ETL workflows, and analytics, simulating a real-world data engineering and reporting scenario.
